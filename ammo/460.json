    "description": ".460 Rowland ammunition with 185gr JHP bullets.  The .460 Rowland round is designed to emulate hard-hitting .44 magnum in common autoloading pistols.  Like the .44, .460 Rowland has exceptional power - and recoil.  It is almost dimensionally identical to .45ACP, save for having a longer case and deeper seated bullets to prevent ammunition mix-ups.",

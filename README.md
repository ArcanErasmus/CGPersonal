# This is the personal rebalance mod of Closet_Goth\#0083

Changes:
- all vanilla ammo has range increased to 100, so that effective range is limited by dispersion, rather than an arbitrary number
- adds a craftable new item: pair of survivor heelys
- adds a craftable new item: atomic headlamp
- shillelagh can be crafted with tainted tallow or regular tallow, not just butter or lard
- rags disassemble in 5 minutes, thus removing the omnipresent Quest For Thread
- composite crossbow can be crafted with tainted bones, not just human or animal ones
- vehicle-mounted autoclave holds 200L instead of 11, no more waiting forever to sterilize lots of CBMs

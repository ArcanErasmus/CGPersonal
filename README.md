# This is the personal rebalance mod of Closet_Goth\#0083

- Change all regular bullet ammo to the max range (60 tiles), and make some standardizations/tweaks to other types of ammo (musket shot, rockets, etc)
- Buff the range, accuracy, and power consumption of the heavy rail rifle, because I'm petty and if you work hard enough to one, it should be epic
- Continuing the trend of me liking long range, add a new gun that is a customized version of the Mk 12 Mod 0/1, which is a designated marksman's variant of the M16A4. You have to craft it from an M16A4 and a bunch of gunmods.
- Re-add the obsoleted belt feed mod, since it's actually not insanely hard to do. Granted, it *probably* takes a bit more tooling than a survivor has, but whatever, it's fun. Don't remove it while the gun is loaded! Or do, if you want to test what happens for me.
- Change the disassembly time of rags from 1 hour to 5 minutes, to stop the extremely tedious Quest For Thread. It's not fun, and this fixes that.
- Increase the vehicle autoclave volume to 50L, so that you don't have to sterilize a single CBM at a time. Once you have the stuff to sterilize CBMs, power really isn't a problem, so this removes much of the waiting game.
- Allow the composite crossbow to be crafted with tainted bones. At some point I should do this for a lot of items, but whatever.
- Same with the shillelagh, allow use of tallow or tainted tallow, because good luck finding enough butter before it all spoils.
